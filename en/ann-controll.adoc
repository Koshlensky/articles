== Introduction

The quality of digital images is a complex collective concept, depending on the limitations of transmission systems and communication channels, as well as the characteristics of formation and processing environments. For images, a quality parameter is high resolution (HR), corresponding to the tasks set for specific goals and meeting the required level of detail and scene rendering. Due to the limitations of some image formation and processing environments at the hardware level, it is not possible to obtain HR images without additional post-processing [1]. For such environments with low resolution (LR) image formation, recognition based on algorithmic storyboarding should be applied, improving and adapting the quality of images and detail clarity through frame-by-frame scene processing. Storyboarding algorithms allow obtaining the desired HR images by filling a complex of LR images of the same frame and their axial pixel shifts in specific scenes.

One of the negative factors directly affecting the output quality of images is the appearance of gradient noise and its impact on the distribution of disaggregated pixels. Fragmentary disaggregation of images forms areas of pixel overlaps, reducing the final quality. Such areas cannot be eliminated by image filtering, and many modern algorithms are fundamentally not adapted to level them [2]. Iterative linear and non-linear filtering algorithms can solve this problem, but are often not practically justified due to a number of assumptions in building mathematical models.

The task of image post-processing management requires more adaptive dynamic approaches, which can be deep learning methods using special architectures of artificial neural networks – convolutional neural networks and their variations depending on the complexity of the current problem. Deep learning and convolutional neural networks can be applied to manage the solution of frame-by-frame post-processing tasks due to the lack of need to build mathematical models, but at the same time, there are limitations typical of the learning process in the form of large training samples, large volumes of data from analyzed image examples, and time for processing and learning.

The scientific novelty of the method presented in the work is the adaptation of the advantages of deep learning of convolutional neural networks and segmentation of gradient noise in the pre-processing of LR images in a specific complex of tasks using algorithmic storyboarding.

=== Image Post-Processing Management

To solve the task set in the work of managing image quality in specific cases, an adaptive approach with refinement of scene complexes' estimates is applied. Let us assume that there are stem:[N] LR images stem:[F^Q] in a row (stem:[d^L], stem:[w^L], stem:[c]) which are subjected to the impact of gradient noise and fragmentary pixel disaggregation [3]. The task is to obtain an HR image (stem:[F^H]) with quality higher than the original without the influence of gradient noise.

A specific solution to the problem will be an approach using an algorithmic evaluation complex. In addition to the current task of gradient noise segmentation in the iterative post-processing scheme, a significant advantage is the image evaluation and its accuracy, based on which the quality of axial pixel shifts between images of one scene is determined. Gradient noise impact directly affects the evaluation index, as it pixel-by-pixel reduces the quality of the selected area. The approach using evaluation refinements takes into account possible shortcomings when registering LR images and, upon updating their evaluation, forms an updated HR image evaluation. The image post-processing scheme with an evaluation system (fig. 1) consists of three sequential iterations:

. evaluation of axial pixel shifts of neighboring consecutive images of one scene and registration of the current image;
. managing the obtained HR image evaluation for its update;
. updating the evaluation cycle until the desired result is obtained.

The main advantage of the presented image post-processing scheme is managing the accuracy of the HR image evaluation due to axial pixel shifts of LR scene images. The information obtained during each iteration of LR image evaluation contributes to leveling the negative impact of gradient noise. The scheme's feature is simultaneous leveling of gradient noise along with increasing the resolution of LR and HR images, respectively. The sequence of LR image processing is not fixed and has a free length with single processing of the current scene.

Due to the approximate accuracy of evaluation approaches, not guaranteed to refer to exact assumptions about the statistical properties of the original images, "incorrect evaluations" may occur.

The lack of strict rules for forming the lengths of processing selected scenes affects not only the final result but also the time spent on each scene processing iteration.

=== Image Processing Using Artificial Neural Networks

To solve the problem of improving image quality and leveling the negative impact of gradient noise, the best choice will be artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs and management based on them do not require data models and are distinguished by exceptional speed when the structure is already trained.

The approach using ANNs, specifically convolutional neural networks, for registering images and increasing/restoring their resolution has already been practically implemented in the FVRSR algorithm [4]. LR image registration was fixed using the LiteFlowNet2 convolutional neural network, developed based on CVPR LiteFlowNet and having solved the problem of optical flow estimation, which hindered work on images in the previous version [5]. The application of LifeFlowNet2 will further improve the accuracy of LR evaluations and enhance the final scene display detail. The TensorFlow library is used for deep learning LiteFlowNet2.

The convolutional neural network is managed by processing the reception of two images of different resolutions – HR evaluation and an LR image with increased clarity through axial pixel shifts and storyboarding. The final result of their merging will be one image with an updated evaluation according to a similar scheme (fig. 1).

After a series of research works, it was possible to obtain a result in the form of partial gradient noise leveling, but such an approach does not solve the problem of noise impact initially affecting the source image. Impact on the source image will lead to pixel distortions even after passing through post-processing with the evaluation system. Moreover, this approach will not yield results in the field of deep learning of the neural network, offering fundamentally incorrect recognition areas and adapting them incorrectly. For the hypothetical improvement of the image post-processing scheme (fig. 1), we will add to the algorithm the calculation of the average evaluation of the source image with sequential processing and isolated pixel segmentation.

The introduction of a convolutional neural network for storyboarding with an average evaluation of the source image and sequential processing can adapt previously created approaches with a classic evaluation system without using ANNs. The introduction of ANNs will allow the implementation of management of pre-trained neural networks according to the principle of the DAG network, allowing a consistent composition of the complex storyboarding of images to obtain a new, different from the current HR evaluation [6].

The descriptive part of the new scheme with ANN management consists of the following sequential stages:

. start of ANN management;
. formation of the average evaluation of the HR source image based on the LR source images of the current scene;
. registration of the current scene image;
. pixel segmentation of areas affected by gradient noise on the current LR scene;
. composition and update of the new evaluation based on data on pixel segmentation of areas with gradient noise and the current scene image evaluation;
. cyclic repetition of points 2-4 until a satisfactory result is obtained in the form of an LR storyboard complex;
. end of the cycle upon obtaining the last HR image evaluation and its acceptance as the final HR image;
. end of management, work completion.

For the new scheme, the registration of subsequent HR images occurs via the LiteFlowNet2 neural network and axial shifting of the considered image onto the source image. Each layer of the convolutional neural network for the storyboard approach and average HR evaluation step-by-step increases the final quality of the result, forming a complex of two jointly working subnetworks and solving the problem of gradient noise and pixel distortions.

=== Training of ANN and Storyboarding of Images

Training an ANN and, specifically, a convolutional neural network follows the principle of optimal deep learning – the absence of unnecessary training samples, no need for retraining, and avoidance of erroneous training. The convolutional neural network will be trained using the stochastic gradient descent method with a sample of 50 HR images of one scene with different percentages of gradient damage to clarity [7]. To protect against overfitting, the "dropout" approach with the method of discarding random individual neurons will be applied. Since the work of a convolutional neural network is based on fully connected layers, it is required to combine scene images into a training set.

Then the training set for the convolutional neural network with a set of stem:[n] images of a stem:[l]-sequence will be calculated by the formula

[.text-center]
stem:[f(h^i=l/z_j^i)=(e^(z^i)l)/(sum_(n=1)^k e^(z^i)n)]

where stem:[n] is the current set of images of the current scene; stem:[h(i)] is the first half of the training set in HR with the stem:[i]-th positive fragment of the scene; stem:[l] is the sequence of the current set of images; stem:[z^i] is the second half of the training set in HR with the stem:[i]-th negative fragment of the scene.

Due to the quantitative predominance of degrees of freedom in convolutional neural networks, they are prone to slight errors in the output data, which are permissible for our study and do not aggravate HR in terms of quality deterioration by gradient noise. Fig. 3 visually demonstrates the practical result of the work in LiteFlowNet2. The results of images 2 and 3 correspond to the approach shown in fig. 1, the post-processing scheme without using ANN and deep learning. Image 4 is minimally affected by gradient noise and shows the result closest to the original and corresponds to the image clarity level in HR:

=== Conclusion

Thus, the new approach to image post-processing presented in the work using ANN and deep learning shows a higher quality result in the field of leveling gradient noise and obtaining HR output images compared to the previous version without using convolutional neural networks and training. In the future, the accuracy of the applied approach can be increased due to the new version of the LiteFlowNet3 training environment after its final debugging and readiness for mass use.
